title: Tutorial Shadcn
description: >-
  Shadcn UI takes a different approach from other UI and component libraries
  like Material UI and Chakra UI. Where those libraries offer access to
  components through their bundled packages, Shadcn UI does something different
  and instead allows you to download the source code for individual UI
  components into your codebase.
